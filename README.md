## Logic
Logic is a software copy of the Divergent Waves Logic module, with a couple of small changes for better VCV Rack compatibility.

The VCV Rack module performs one of the five logic operations which are supported by the hardware module. In the hardware
module the logic chip on the back of the PCB must be swapped out, but for the VCV Rack version all supported logic types are
available on the right click menu for the module. The logic type is persisted when restarting VCV Rack.

Inputs:
- Threshold voltage of 1.2v

Outputs:
- At 10v
